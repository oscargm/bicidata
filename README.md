# BICIDATA

## Description

Project thought to play with Barcelona Bicing (public bicycle sharing platform).
Current state data is stored [here](https://barcelona-sp.publicbikesystem.net/ube/gbfs/v1/). This API doesn't have historic data, so the plan is to connect this project with [another project](https://github.com/bicidata/bicidata) that gathers current data in intervals and saves snapshots.
